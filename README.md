# linkedin-wall
A highly configurable software to host a linkedin wall service.

## ?? What is This ??
Users will send messages on Linkedin that tag your organisation i.e:

> @HRUL\_Compsoc doing a great job at 80s90s00s, they need to play more ABBA though!!1

then, with optional AI based moderation, a wall of these great messages will be accessible
on the web interface to project onto something.

## ?? Why ??
Twiter walls are no longer the cool sh$t, all the cool kids use Linkedin these days.

## State of Development
Nowhere near ready. Paypal me Â£2 and it might get finished sooner...
